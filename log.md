**Thoughts**
* I always love games, so adding [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html) to 
  the course was fun. I had actually never seen a "jumping hurdles" or "maze" 
  challenge before, so although easy to solve, it was still much more enjoyable than 
  your usual while loop exercises. This is something I will probably end up showing to 
  the kids when they want to move on from blockly and start learning Python.

* [Password Generator](https://github.com/StingzLD/password-generator)

**Thoughts**
* Today's project was actually a pretty beneficial one, as it is something I use on a 
  regular basis for my job: A Password Generator. The general creation of the tool may 
  not have been very complex, however I did end up searching for and finding a new 
  method I have never used before: Shuffle. I have never had a need to shuffle a list 
  before, so it was pretty nifty to learn something new. I am definitely going to 
  continue to refine this password generator and cater it towards my exact needs.

* [Rock Paper Scissors Terminal Game](https://github.com/StingzLD/rock-paper-scissors)

**Thoughts**
* Creating the [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/StingzLD/rock-paper-scissors) 
  game was a bit more fun using the actual representation of the hand gesture in the 
  console. I think the logic could use some cleaning up, as I used hard coded 
  evaluations which would not scale well if there were more than three choices, so I 
  may work on that later. The trick to this, though, would be simplifying the logic 
  while also maintaining the detailed results of the game. For now, though, the game 
  is fully functional and a fun way to kill a minute or two.

### Day 3: December 10, 2022

**Thoughts**
* The project for today might have been a simplistic one, but it was definitely fun and 
got the creative juices flowing. It was a *Choose Your Own Adventure* game called 
**Treasure Island**. If you want to take a peek at it, just head hit the Replit link 
above and take a look at the treasure-island.py file.

### Day 2: December 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**

* [Day 2 - Replit](https://replit.com/@StingzLD/100DaysOfPython-Day-2)

**Thoughts**
* Although this course is still in the very basics, I have decided to just go through 
the motions, as there may be a piece of information I did not know or a trick that I 
might learn. Either way, Day 2 complete!

### Day 1: December 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**

**Thoughts**
* Today I made the decision to challenge myself with another 100DaysOfCode challenge! It 
has been about a year since I last really touched Python, as I have been primarily 
coding with PowerShell, and I want to ensure I do not get rusty. I want my main focus 
to be more on topics I do not have much experience in with Python, specifically: APIs, 
creating applications and websites, scraping, etc. With my currently hectic schedule, 
I do not want to spend a lot of time researching how to do things. As such, I set out 
to find pre-designed content that would allow me to push my knowledge and complete my 
goal.
<br><br>
Luckily, I found [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023
](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), which appears to be just what I am 
looking for. Although I took the assessment and was told to start a third of the way 
in, I have decided to just go through the entire course as is, since there are projects 
that I would miss out on. And who knows, I might learn something new about a *"basic"* 
concept! That has certainly happened to me in the recent past, so maybe I will find 
some new trick I have never seen before.

Here's to 100 Days of Python!
