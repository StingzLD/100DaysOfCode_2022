**Thoughts**
Although this course is still in the very basics, I have decided to just go through 
the motions, as there may be a piece of information I did not know or a trick that I 
might learn. Either way, Day 2 complete!

**Thoughts**

Today I made the decision to challenge myself with another 100DaysOfCode challenge! It 
has been about a year since I last really touched Python, as I have been primarily 
coding with PowerShell, and I want to ensure I do not get rusty. I want my main focus 
to be more on topics I do not have much experience in with Python, specifically: APIs, 
creating applications and websites, scraping, etc. With my currently hectic schedule, 
I do not want to spend a lot of time researching how to do things. As such, I set out 
to find pre-designed content that would allow me to push my knowledge and complete my 
goal.

Luckily, I found [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023
](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), which appears to be just what I am 
looking for. Although I took the assessment and was told to start a third of the way 
in, I have decided to just go through the entire course as is, since there are projects 
that I would miss out on. And who knows, I might learn something new about a *"basic"* 
concept! That has certainly happened to me in the recent past, so maybe I will find 
some new trick I have never seen before.

Here's to 100 Days of Python!
