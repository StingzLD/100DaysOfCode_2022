# 100 Days of Python Challenge

## Main Commitment
#### *I will complete the [100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) course*

<br>Original Commitment:<br>
I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days

Reason for Commitment Change:<br>
As a family man who is also going back to school and is very career focused, I found it extremely hard
to commit to coding every day. There are two main reasons for this. One, I like to take things to the next
level. A lot of people will just go through a course and do the bare minimum, but I often feel like there
is something else I want the code to do, and so I figure out how to do it. Being a completionist, this means
that I end up spending multiple hours working through different iterations of the code in order to get it
where I want it to be. Taking all that time, when I have very, very little free time to being with, is a
heavy burden that I simply had to offload.

The biggest reason for doing the challenge is to push yourself and learn things you never would have otherwise.
I take this to heart, and that is still my main goal. Learning is my top priority, not how quickly I was able
to do so. Because of this, as of August 4, 2023, I am officially switching my goal from coding for one hour a
day to completing the [100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) course. I am already
one third of the way finished with the course, and by the end of it, my knowledge will have vastly increased.
I am super excited to continue this course, and I cannot wait to see what is next!

## Start Date
